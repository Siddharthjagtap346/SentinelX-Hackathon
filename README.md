# 🛡 SentinelX

### Autonomous Cross-Chain Risk & Reserve Enforcement Engine Powered by Chainlink CRE

---

SentinelX Hackathon Submission – Multi-chain Smart Contracts, CRE workflow automation, Proof-of-reserve feed and demo scripts demonstrating real-time monitoring, triggers, and convergence across blockchain environments for SentinelX Convergence Hackathon 2026.

---

# 🧠 What Is SentinelX?

SentinelX is a **production-grade autonomous financial risk control system** built using the **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)**.

It continuously:

* Fetches real-world market prices
* Verifies custodian-signed reserve attestations
* Computes vault health ratios
* Calculates systemic risk across vaults
* Enforces cross-chain liquidations
* Freezes the entire system if Proof-of-Reserve fails

This is **not a demo UI** — it is a real automated execution engine designed for:

* Stablecoin issuers
* RWA tokenization platforms
* Cross-chain DeFi protocols
* Institutional onchain risk management

---

# 🎯 Problem We Solve

Modern DeFi systems fail because:

* Liquidations are reactive
* Reserve verification is manual
* Risk scoring is isolated per protocol
* No global systemic risk logic exists
* Cross-chain enforcement is fragile
* No autonomous pause mechanism tied to real-world data

SentinelX introduces:

> 🔥 **Autonomous, cryptographically verified, cross-chain risk enforcement powered by decentralized oracle execution.**

# 🔗 Chains Used

### 🟢 Chain A (Vault Layer)

* RiskVault
* GlobalGuardian (global circuit breaker)
* MockStableCoin (sUSD)
* SentinelXReserveAuthority (PoR enforcement)

### 🔵 Chain B (Execution Layer)

* RiskExecutor
* Cross-chain execution guardrails
* Replay protection
* Nonce validation

CRE orchestrates actions between both chains.

---

# ⚙️ How It Works (Full Flow)

## 1️⃣ Price Consensus

* Fetches ETH price from CoinGecko (real)
* Fetches controlled internal price
* Runs deviation check
* Applies advanced consensus logic

If deviation > tolerance → flagged.

---

## 2️⃣ Custodian Reserve Verification

* Fetches `/reserve` from mock custodian
* Verifies:

  * Signature
  * Public key match
  * Timestamp freshness
  * Replay protection
* Uses median consensus aggregation
* Produces reserve health %

---

## 3️⃣ Vault Health Computation

For every vault:

```
Health Ratio = (Collateral × Price × 100) / Debt
```

Escalation tiers:

* NONE
* WARNING
* RESTRICT
* PARTIAL LIQUIDATION
* FULL LIQUIDATION

---

## 4️⃣ Systemic Risk Engine

SentinelX calculates:

* Health dispersion
* Volatility (std deviation)
* Reserve health impact
* Multi-vault correlation

Produces:

```
Systemic Risk Score (0–1)
System Health Index (0–100)
```

---

## 5️⃣ Proof-of-Reserve Enforcement

CRE sends DON-signed report to:

**SentinelXReserveAuthority**

Contract verifies:

* Backing ratio >= 100%
* Risk score below threshold
* Report freshness
* Onchain supply consistency

If violated:

```
GlobalGuardian.pause()
System frozen
```

Autonomous freeze.

---

## 6️⃣ Cross-Chain Liquidation Execution

If escalation required:

CRE → RiskExecutor (Chain B)

RiskExecutor enforces:

* Approved vault list
* Strict nonce sequencing
* Replay protection
* Message hashing
* FreezeReason tracking

Then calls vault on Chain A.

---

# 🔐 Security Features

* DON-signed CRE reports
* Signature-verified custodian attestations
* Replay protection (hash + nonce)
* Cross-chain message integrity
* Global circuit breaker
* Escalation state machine enforcement
* Freshness enforcement for reserve data
* Strict owner-only administrative controls

---

# 🏦 Smart Contracts Overview

# 🖥 SentinelX Monitoring Dashboard (Frontend Output)

SentinelX includes a **production-ready monitoring dashboard** built with Next.js and Ethers.js to visualize real-time system state across both chains.

While CRE runs in simulation mode for the hackathon environment, the dashboard:

* Reads live deployed contract state
* Reflects deterministic state transitions
* Displays escalation tiers and freeze status
* Confirms cross-chain executor behavior
* Shows risk policy engine output

This proves the enforcement engine is stable and production-ready — even though DON coordination is simulated.

---

## 📸 Dashboard Snapshot

<img width="1763" height="1007" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1c84507-166e-43ed-9225-b0ce4169489d" />


---

## 📊 Live Monitoring Output (Captured State)

Below is a real captured output state from the SentinelX dashboard:

### 🟢 Vault Status

* **Risk Tier:** 1
* **Health Ratio:** 0.00%
* **Status:** ACTIVE

### 💰 Collateral & Debt

* **Collateral:** 10 ETH
* **Debt:** 10,000 ETH
* **Health Ratio:** 0

### 📈 Price Monitor

* **Real Price:** $200
* **Controlled Price:** $1950
* **Deviation:** 875.00%

This confirms:

* Price deviation logic is functioning
* Consensus deviation detection is active
* Risk policy escalation engine responding correctly

---

### 🧠 Risk Policy Engine

* **Current Tier:** 1
* **Liquidation Threshold:** 150%

Escalation logic is computed deterministically based on:

```
Health Ratio = (Collateral × Price × 100) / Debt
```

---

### 🔁 CRE Automated Enforcement

* **Last Executor Vault:** `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
* **Last Execution Timestamp:** No actions yet

Vault actions (Partial / Full / Freeze) are executed automatically by CRE RiskExecutor when thresholds are crossed.

---

### 🔵 Cross-Chain Executor Status

* **Last Vault Executed:** `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
* **Last Execution:** None

This confirms:

* Nonce sequencing initialized
* Executor registry configured
* No replay attempts
* Execution pipeline ready

---

### 🧾 Engine Logs

```
System initialized
Awaiting price consensus...
```

Demonstrates:

* Workflow boot sequence
* Trigger initialization
* Awaiting price median consensus
* Deterministic execution cycle

---

# ⚠️ Important — Simulation Clarification

For hackathon constraints:

CRE is executed via:

```
cre workflow simulate ./sentinelx-workflow --target staging-settings --broadcast
```

What is simulated:

* DON coordination layer
* Oracle network execution

What is real:

* Smart contracts deployed
* Escalation state machine logic
* Nonce enforcement
* Cross-chain executor
* Freeze authority
* Risk scoring computation
* Deterministic state transitions
* Vault liquidation logic

The enforcement engine is fully functional — only the decentralized oracle network layer is simulated.
